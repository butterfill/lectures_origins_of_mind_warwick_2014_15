      .notes Our overall project is to understand something about the emergence of knowledge of minds, objects, colours and the rest in human development.
      .notes My proposal is that we have to take two factors into account.  One is core knowledge, the other is social interaction.
      .notes Our current project is to understand where abilities to communicate fit into this picture---to understand, that is, what role they might play in explaining how humans come to know things.

            span.bkg-words-highlight-invert non-linguistic communication
          .notes Non-linguistic communication is special because it links to two of our ambitions.
          .notes First, we want to better understand how humans acquire abilities to communicate by language, and these seem to be built on their non-linguistic abilities.
          .notes Second, non-linguistic communication appears to be a paradigm manifestation of social intelligence, and perhaps one that doesn't already require any knowledge knowledge at all.
          .notes So non-linguistic communication may be an aspect of social intelligence that can explain the origins of knowledge in development.

  .notes As I mentioned before, my overall plan is to work backwards from communication by language through non-linguistic communication and so to understanding action.

    ul
      li request
      li inform
      li initiate joint engagement (‘Wow! That!’)
  .notes Why is this significant?
  .notes Because it implies two things:
  .notes First, it implies that infants' pointing is referential communication; that is, communication about an object.
  .notes (Contrast sharing a smile; we're communicating, but not necessarily referring.)
  .notes Second, it implies that infants have some understanding of joint engagement.

  .notes I don't want to pursue this here; I'm just mentioning it because you might want to draw on pointing in your seminar essays.
  .notes Instead I want to ask in a simpler way, how should we understand pointing as other non-linguistic forms of communication?
  .notes To approach this question, it's helpful to compare and contrast humans with other, nonhuman apes.
  +invert('.cooperation')
  .notes Here is a beautifully simple story.  Humans are highly cooperative from birth.  Being highly cooperative enables them to communicate, linguistically and non-linguistically.  Being able to communicate in turn enables them to acquire knowledge of minds, physical objects, numbers and the rest.  This is a beautiful story and conceptually simple.  Of course the challenge is to get from the story to the details.

  .notes In this experiment, we contrast failed reaches with pointing ...
  .notes Hare and Call (\citeyear{hare_chimpanzees_2004}) contrast pointing with a failed reach as two ways of indicating which of two closed containers a reward is in.  Chimps can easily interpret a failed reach but are stumped by the point to a closed container.
  .notes You are the subjects.  This is what you saw (two conditions).  Your task was to choose the container with the reward.
  .notes Infants can do this sort of task, it's really easy for them \citep{Behne:2005qh}.  (And, incidentally, they distinguish communicative points from similar but non-communicative bodily configurations.)
  .notes The pictures in the figure stand for what participants, who were chimpanzees, saw.
  .notes The question was whether participants would be able to work out which of two containers concealed a reward.
  .notes In the condition depicted in the left panel, participants saw a chimpanzee trying but failing to reach for the correct container. 
  .notes Participants had no problem getting the reward in this case, suggesting that they understood the goal of the failed reach.
  .notes In the condition depicted in the right panel, a human pointed at the correct container.
  .notes Participants did not get the reward in this case as often as in the failed reach case, suggesting that they failed to understand the goal of the pointing action.
  .notes (Actually the apes were above chance in using the point, just better in the failed reach condition.  Hare et al comment ;chimpanzees can learn to exploit a pointing cue with some experience, as established by previous research (Povinelli et al. 1997; Call et al. 1998, 2000), and so by the time they engaged in this condition they had learned to use arm extension as a discriminative cue to the food’s location' \citep[p.\ 578]{hare_chimpanzees_2004}.)
  .notes \footnote{
    | The contrast between the two conditions is not due merely to the fact that one involves a human and the other a chimpanzee. 
    | Participants were also successful when the failed reach was executed by a human rather than another chimpanzee \citep[][experiment 1]{hare_chimpanzees_2004}.

  .notes Tomasello also asks this question.
  .notes.handout ‘the specific behavioral form — distinctive hand shape with extended index finger — actually emerges reliably in infants as young as 3 months of age (Hannan \& Fogel, 1987). […] why do infants not learn to use the extended index finger for these social functions at 3 – 6 months of age, but only at 12 months of age?’ \citep[p.\ 716]{Tomasello:2007fi}
  .notes (Again Tomasello's answer involves shared intentionality: it's because they don't understand shared intentionality until around their first birthdays.)
  .notes We can answer this in the same way --- they don't understand communication.

+slide
  .notes This makes sense of why chimpanzees don't point --- they don't understand communicative intention.
  p Why don’t apes point?

  p.em-above Because they fail to ‘understand that by pointing towards a location, the other attempts

  .notes Note that this is an explanation which doesn't mention shared intentionality.
  .notes That's deliberate; sometimes Tomasello and colleagues answer this question by appeal to shared intentionality; I wanted to consider a simpler answer first and postpone thinking about shared intentionality for as long as possible.
