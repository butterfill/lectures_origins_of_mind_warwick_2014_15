  .notes: :t()
    I'm presenting this experiment as showing that infants represent objects as persisting, and do so
    in accordance with the Principle of Continuity.  However, the experiment is also about 
    causal interactions between objects.  After all, infants are demonstrating sensitivity to
    the fact that a solid object must stop the drawbridge from rotating all the way back.
  .notes: :t()
    Some have been critical of the methods used in this experiment.
    But not everything hangs on this experiment.
    Fortunately there are at least a hundred further experiments which provide evidence pointing in the same direction.
    Here we'll look at just one more experiment.



//- -----------------------
//- big objects can't be fully occluded by narrow occluders    
+slide
  .notes Here is another way of demonstrating object permanence.
  .notes: :t()
    This experiment will suggest, incidentally, that the principles we have seen---continuity,
    rigidity and the rest---don't fully explain how infants succeed in representing objects as persisting.
  .notes The subjects were 4 month old infants.
  .notes They were shown a large object disappearing inside a small conatiner, or behind a narrow screen.

  .notes The experiment was very simple.
  .notes All the experimenters did was measure how long infants looked in at the two events.

  .notes How should we interpret these results?
  .handout Interpreting violation-of-expectation experiments: 
  .handout ‘evidence that infants look reliably longer at the unexpected than at the expected event is taken to indicate that they (1) possess the expectation under investigation; (2) detect the violation in the unexpected event; and (3) are surprised by this violation. The term surprise is used here simply as a short-hand descriptor, to denote a state of heightened attention or interest caused by an expectation violation.’

  .notes Note that we are talking about expectations.
  .notes This raises two questions: How do we arrive at these expectations? and What is an expectation?
  .notes Spelke's claim is that we arrive at these expectations by inference from the Principles of Object Perception, including the principle of contintuity.
  .notes So what is an expectation?  
  .notes On the simple view we are adopting for now, an expectation is just a belief.
  .notes The attraction of this simple view is it allows us to take literally the claim that we know the principles of object perception and arrive at expectations by a process of inference.

  .notes So the abilities to segment objects and to represent them as persisting are conceptually distinct.
  .notes However it may be that knowledge of a single set of principles underlies both abilities.
  .notes This is one of Spelke's brilliant insights.
  .notes Where does this leave us?
  .notes We still want to know about the status of the principles of object perception.
  .notes But we now the question is more pressing.
  .notes Because the claim that these principles of object perception explain infants' (and adults', and other primates') performance is now harder to reject.
  .notes It's harder to reject because we have converging evidence for the psychological reality of the principles from both segmentation and permanence.
