    How do humans first come to know  about---and to knowingly manipulate---objects, causes, words, 
    numbers, colours, actions and minds?
    In a beautiful myth, Plato (who also asked this question) suggests that the answer is 
    recollection. 
    Before we are born, in another world, we become acquainted with the truth. 
    Then, in falling to earth, we forget everything. 
    But as we grow we are sometimes able to recall part of what we once knew.
    So it is by recollection that humans come to know about objects, causes, numbers and everything 
    else.

    [The quote continues ‘humans are endowed neither with a single, general-purpose learning system 
    nor with myriad special-purpose systems and predispositions. Instead, we believe that humans 
    are endowed with a small number of separable systems of core knowledge. New, flexible skills 
    and belief systems build on these core foundations.’]

    The claim that we should shift from thinking about myths to mechanisms raises two questions.
    First, what are the mechanisms?
    And, second, why suppose there is any role for philosophers rather than scientists?
    Let me take the second question first ...
