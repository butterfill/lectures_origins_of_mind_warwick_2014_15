  .notes There are perceptual expectations.
  .notes Suppose you saw this image.
  .notes The triangle behind the thumb is in some sense perceptually present, even though you can't see it.
  +clip('img','auto')
  .notes But now the thumb comes away and what you see is not the triangle you were expecting.
  .notes Could these perceptual expectations be just a matter of knowledge?
  .notes No, because perceptual expectations are judgement-independent.
  .notes As \citep{kellman:1983_perception} report, Michotte, Thines and Crabbe found that subjects report seeing a single large triangle behind the thumb even when they know that there isn't one there.
  .notes You can cover and reveal the triangles repeatedly, but the expectation will hold firm.
  .notes &nbsp;
  .notes The experience you have when the thumb is removed is like that of infants' in violation-of-expectation tasks.
  .notes This is what it is like to be an infant.

  p.center representational momentum
  .notes You see an object move on a screen in some way.
  .notes The screen goes blank and you are asked to say where the object was last.
  .notes Subjects typically locate the object just a bit further on, as if it had continued moving after the screen went blank.
  .notes This is called representational momentum as a sort of joke; the idea is that the representation keeps moving if the object stop abruptly enough.
  .notes It's not interesting in itself, but it's useful for us.
  .notes Why is it useful?  Because it can tell us about the paths that the perceptual system expects objects to travel on.

  .notes The effect of mass on the rate of ascending motion: impetus and Newtonian theories come apart.
  .notes Important because it shows limits (people know better than their perceptual systems)

  p.source Kozhevnikov and Hegarty 2001, figure (from appendix)
  .notes adults, including trained physicists who make correct verbal predictions about the effects of mass on motion, show representational momentum (a perceptual effect) consistent with impetus and inconsistent with Newtonian mechanics.  So again we have (i) judgement-independence and (ii) adults.  ('both physics experts and novices possess the same set of implicit beliefs about motion.' \citep[p.\ 451]{kozhevnikov:2001_impetus})
  .notes --- limits of infants' systems found in adults shows that we can identify the system as persisting 
  .notes --- note that other studies also show judgement-independence, but in the other way (implicit knowledge of physical interactions more accurate than judgement: 'a number of previous studies suggesting a dissociation between explicit and implicit knowledge of the principles of physics. For instance, Hubbard suggests that implicit knowledge reflects internalization of invariant physical principles, whereas explicit knowledge about motion may be less accurate. Similarly, Krist et al. (1993) suggested that perceptually based knowledge is more accurate than verbal concepts of motion.' \citep[p.\ 450]{kozhevnikov:2001_impetus}
  .notes --- What questions does this bear on?  (1) perceptual & modular nature of infants' understanding of objects and their interactions; (2) relation between infant competence and adults' (do the thing about system being transformed or discarded versus two systems persisting through development : this is different from issues about innateness, which looks from infants' competence backwards --- here we go in the other direction, looking forwards); and (3) trade-offs between flexibility and efficiency (see below; worth talking about this in some detail here)
  .notes --- on cognitive efficiency:  	'To extrapolate objects’ motion on the basis of physical principles, one should have assessed and evaluated the presence and magnitude of such imperceptible forces as friction and air resistance operating in the real world.  This would require a time-consuming analysis that is not always possible. In order to have a survival advantage, the process of extrapolation should be fast and effortless, without much conscious deliberation. Impetus theory allows us to extrapolate objects’ motion quickly and without large demands on attentional resources.' \citep[p.\ 450]{kozhevnikov:2001_impetus}
  .notes **caution (basically fine, but need to be careful): 'The extent to which displacement reflects physical principles per se has been widely debated in the literature; theories of displacement suggest a variety of potential effects of physical principles ranging from an incorporation of the principle of momentum into mental representation (e.g., Finke et al., 1986) to a rejection of any internalization of physical principles (e.g., Kerzel, 2000, 2003a). The empirical evidence is clear that (1) displacement does not always correspond to predictions based on physical principles and (2) variables unrelated to physical principles (e.g., the presence of landmarks, target identity, or expectations regarding a change in target direction) can influence displacement. ... information based on a naive understanding of physical principles or on subjective consequences of physical principles appears to be just one of many types of information that could potentially contribute to the displacement of any given target' \citep[p.\ 842]{hubbard:2005_representational}

  p.center so what?
  .notes To have a perceptual expectation about the location of an object (say) is distcint from (i) knowing its location; (ii) seeing it
  .notes Infants' expectations about objects are perceptual expectations.
  .notes These expectations are a consequence of core knowledge of objects, i.e. the mechanism underwriting object indexes.
  .notes This explains why the expectations guide the eyes but do not influence planned actions (such as searches).
