  .notes There is a puzzle about when humans can first know individuating facts about others' beliefs.
  .notes To understand the origins of this knowledge we need to understand the puzzle.
  .notes So I'm going to reveal the puzzle to you.  But let me start with a bit of background.

  .notes Recall the experiment that got us started.
  .notes These experimenters added an anticipation prompt and measured to which box subjects looked first \citep{Clements:1994cw}.
  .notes (Actually they didn't use this story; theirs was about a mouse called Sam and some cheese, but the differences needn't concern us.)

  .notes What got me hooked philosophical psychology, 
    | and on philosophical issues in the development of mindreading in particular 
    | was a brilliant finding by Wendy Clements who was Josef Perner's phd student.

  .notes These findings were carefully confirmed \citep{Clements:2000nc,Garnham:2001ql,Ruffman:2001ng}. 
  .notes Around 2000 there were a variety of findings pointing in the direction of a confict between different measures. 
  .notes These included studies on word learning \citep{Carpenter:2002gc,Happe:2002sr} and false denials \citep{Polak:1999xr}.

+slide_theChallenge
  .notes The challenge is to explain the emergence, in evolution or development, of mindreading.
  .notes Initially it looked like this was going to be relatively straightforward and involve just language, social interaction and executive function.
  .notes So a Myth of Jones style story seemed viable.
  .notes But the findings of competence in infants of around one year of age changes this.
  .notes These findings tell us that not all abilities to represent others' mental states can depend on things like language.
  .notes And, as I've been stressing, these findings also create a puzzle.
  .notes The puzzle is, roughly, how to reconcile infants' competence with three-year-olds' failure.
  

+slide({bkg:'slide_lecture04_013.jpg'})
  .notes The puzzle is a little bit like the puzzle we had in the case of knowledge of physical objects.
  .notes But it's also different.
  .notes In the case of physical objects, the conflict was between measures involving looking and measures involving searching.
  .notes In this case it's different, because on the infant side there is not just looking but also acting (e.g. helping) and even communicating.
  .notes &nbsp;
  .notes *todo*: There are at least two possible puzzles you might focus on:
  .notes 1. How can we avoid the apparent contradiction in the evidence?
  .notes 2. How can we explain the apparent discrepancy between infants and 3-year-olds' performances?
  .notes Minimal theory of mind might resolve puzzle 1 but it won't by itself resolve puzzle 2.
  .notes This wasn't clear enough in the lecture (sorry!).


+slide_middle
  p.center Is core knowledge (modularity) the solution?
  .notes Can we solve the puzzle by appeal to core knowledge (or 'modularity')?
  .notes The difference in measures is a hopeful sign that we can.
  .notes But the fact that representations of others' minds influence 1-year-olds' actions (e.g. in communicating and helping) complicates things because we imagine modules as inferentially isolated from practical reasoning.
  .notes Looking at a further puzzle will help us.
