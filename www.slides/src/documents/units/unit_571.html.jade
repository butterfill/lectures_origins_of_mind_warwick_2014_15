  .notes Is there an alternative picture of communication by language, one without mapping or training?
  p.center communication by language without mapping or training

+slide_middle
  .notes In thinking about the alternative picture, I'm guided by two thoughts.
  .notes The first concerns social interaction.
  p.center social interaction
  .notes So far we've considered two pictures of how children learn to communicate with words: training and reasoning to word-concept mappings.
  .notes Both pictures miss social interaction.
  .notes On one picture the infant is an outsider who might as well be observing those around her through a telescope.
  .notes On the other picture the child is a blank to be shaped by those around her.
  .notes There is no meaningful interaction between the infant and adults around her; or, if there is, it makes no difference to her development.
  .notes But could there be a role for social interaction in learning the meanings of words?
  .notes If you think about the examples of creativity --- homesigns and puttaputta --- this seems plausible.
  .notes Communication with words happens in the context of joint action, and it is a tool for joint action.

+slide
  .notes The alternative picture is based on the ideas of Michael Tomasello and his colleagues.

  .notes The second guiding thought in creating the alternative picture concens creativity.
  p.center language creation
  .notes It's standard to suppose that creativity is a side-issue and that learning from those around us is the norm.
  .notes This view is encouraged by the idea that language is fundamentally a system of conventions, and that coming to communicate with words is a matter of getting into those conventions.
  .notes Nothing could be further from the truth.
  .notes Acquiring the ability to communicate with words is an essentially creative process.
  .notes Conventions in the surrounding culture can be useful, but they are no more than useful accessories.

    p
      span.handout.show ‘it is an error to suppose we have seen deeply into the heart of linguistic communication when we have noticed how society bends linguistic habits to a public norm.
      span ’
    .handout.ctd  …  But in indicating this element of the conventional, or of the conditioning process that makes speakers rough linguistic facsimiles of their friends and parents, we explain no more than the convergence; we throw no light on the essential nature of the skills that are thus made to converge.’

    p.handout.show ‘convention does not help explain what is basic to linguistic communication, though it may describe a usual, though contingent feature.’

      span ’
      .handout.ctd  Moral, social or legal considerations may sometimes invite us to deny this, but I do not think the reasons for such exceptions reveal anything of importance about what is basic to communication’

  .notes I'm going to create a view out of them.

  p Grice on meaning
  p.em-above 'A speaker S non-naturally means something by an utterance x if and only if, for some hearer (or audience) H, S utters x intending:
  p (1)	H to produce a particular response r, and
  p (2)	H to recognise that S intends (1).
