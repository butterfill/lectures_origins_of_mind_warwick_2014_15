    The main theme of this lecture is knowledge of causal interactions.
    My question is: How do infants first acquire knowledge of particular causal 
    interactions among objects.
    I want to approach this question in an odd way, by thinking about the perception of causation
    in adults.
    But before I come to that, I also want to mention that there is a second theme for this lecture.
  +show('.step2')
  .notes: :t()
    In this lecture I want to consider several interlocking themes simultaneously.
    The second theme is the problem I introduced in the last lecture, which arises from
    the failure of the Simple View.
    The problem is to understand the relation between infants' abilities regarding physical objects
    and the Spelke principles which describe these given that the principles and their deliverances
    are not actually knowledge.
    It turns out that thinking about the perception of causation will help us with this theme too.

    Now since the last lecture was a week ago, 
    let me start by giving you a very recap.
    What is the Simple View, why does it fail and why is its failure a problem?
  
  
// recap : three questions
mixin insert_unit({unit:'221', title_slide:true, images:images})

// non-solutions; parable of the wrock (rock without mass); strength
mixin insert_unit({unit:'230', title_slide:true, images:images})

// intro to core knowledge / modularity
mixin insert_unit({unit:'231', title_slide:true, images:images})


// computation is the real essence of modularity
mixin insert_unit({unit:'291', title_slide:true, images:images})

// core knowledge / modular representation : paradigm cases
// ***abandoned
// mixin insert_unit({unit:'241', title_slide:true, images:images})
  
// perception of causation
mixin insert_unit({unit:'251', title_slide:true, images:images})
  
// object indexes (object files) and causal perception
mixin insert_unit({unit:'261', title_slide:true, images:images})
  
// perceptual expectations
mixin insert_unit({unit:'271', title_slide:true, images:images})


// conclusions
mixin insert_unit({unit:'281', title_slide:true, images:images})



//- core knowledge and categorical perception --- how related?
//- *todo* lots of useful material here
  mixin insert_unit({unit:'151', title_slide:true, images:images})

  on core knowledge:
    - first talk about knowledge of syntax?
    - principles and parameters
    - poverty of stimulus (quote from Chomsky on Skinner?)
    - not linked to consciousness, not available for introspection, ...
    - Searle's objection
    - defence: respectable notions of representation?  (Shea ideas)
    - how is this a model: it invovles a set of principles being used in an inference-like process
    - compare Spelke on principles of object perception
