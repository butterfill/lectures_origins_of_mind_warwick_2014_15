//- 
  Need some kind of recap to the problems and solutions I suggested
  - the Simple View 
  - is wrong
  - this is a problem (what else is it if not knowledge )
  - [sets the scene for core knowledge : try to bring together what we've said in various domains]

  .notes There are principles of object perception that explain abilities to segment objects, to represent them while temporarily unperceived and to track their interactions. 
  .notes These principles are not known.  What is their status?
  p.center the question

  .notes I noted earlier that Hood suggests that answering this question requires that we 
    | recognize separable systems of mental representation and different kinds of knowledge. 
  .notes Now I'm going to try to make good on this idea.

    span.blur1 ‘there are 
    span.noblur many separable systems of mental representations 
    span.blur1 ... and 
    span.noblur thus many different kinds of 
      span.highlight2 knowledge. 
    span.blur1 ... the task ... is to contribute to the enterprise of finding the distinct systems of mental representation and to understand their development and integration’

//- surely the philosophers can help us out here? ....
//- Core Knowledge and Modularity
+insert_unit({unit:'231', title_slide:true, images:images})

//- 
  object indexes, perceptual expectations
  categorical perception
  mindreading: automatic processes and minimal models
  ... considering all these together, maybe it is a mistake
  to think that we even need a domain-general notion of core knowledge!



//- syntax
+insert_unit({unit:'641', title_slide:true, images:images})

//- is knowledge of syntax knowledge?

  .notes Now I want to go back the main line of my plan, which calls for us to consider communication generally.
