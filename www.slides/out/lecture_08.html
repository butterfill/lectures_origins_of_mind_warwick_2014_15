        <p>Recap: From around 11 or 12 months of age, humans spontaneously use pointing to ...
          <ul>
            <li>request</li>
            <li>inform</li>

        <div class="notes">Because it implies two things:</div>

        <div class="notes">(Contrast sharing a smile; we're communicating, but not necessarily referring.)</div>

        <div class="notes">I don't want to pursue this here; I'm just mentioning it because you might want to draw on pointing in your seminar essays.</div>
        <div class="notes">Instead I want to ask in a simpler way, how should we understand pointing as other non-linguistic forms of communication?</div>
        <div class="notes">To approach this question, it's helpful to compare and contrast humans with other, nonhuman apes.</div>

        <div class="notes">Here is a beautifully simple story.  Humans are highly cooperative from birth.  Being highly cooperative enables them to communicate, linguistically and non-linguistically.  Being able to communicate in turn enables them to acquire knowledge of minds, physical objects, numbers and the rest.  This is a beautiful story and conceptually simple.  Of course the challenge is to get from the story to the details.</div>

        <div class="notes">There is this additional element, shared intentionality.  I don't understand what it is, but Tomasello and his colleagues are extraordinay scientsits so I think it's worth exploring.</div>
        <div class="notes">That's it for now: all I want to do is highlight that our thinking about pointing is going to connect with questions about shared intentionality.</div>

        <div class="notes">In this experiment, we contrast failed reaches with pointing ...</div>
        <div class="notes">Hare and Call (\citeyear{hare_chimpanzees_2004}) contrast pointing with a failed reach as two ways of indicating which of two closed containers a reward is in.  Chimps can easily interpret a failed reach but are stumped by the point to a closed container.</div>
        <div class="notes">You are the subjects.  This is what you saw (two conditions).  Your task was to choose the container with the reward.</div>
        <div class="notes">Infants can do this sort of task, it's really easy for them \citep{Behne:2005qh}.  (And, incidentally, they distinguish communicative points from similar but non-communicative bodily configurations.)</div>
        <div class="notes">The pictures in the figure stand for what participants, who were chimpanzees, saw.</div>
        <div class="notes">The question was whether participants would be able to work out which of two containers concealed a reward.</div>
        <div class="notes">In the condition depicted in the left panel, participants saw a chimpanzee trying but failing to reach for the correct container. </div>
        <div class="notes">Participants had no problem getting the reward in this case, suggesting that they understood the goal of the failed reach.</div>
        <div class="notes">In the condition depicted in the right panel, a human pointed at the correct container.</div>
        <div class="notes">Participants did not get the reward in this case as often as in the failed reach case, suggesting that they failed to understand the goal of the pointing action.</div>
        <div class="notes">(Actually the apes were above chance in using the point, just better in the failed reach condition.  Hare et al comment ;chimpanzees can learn to exploit a pointing cue with some experience, as established by previous research (Povinelli et al. 1997; Call et al. 1998, 2000), and so by the time they engaged in this condition they had learned to use arm extension as a discriminative cue to the food’s location' \citep[p.\ 578]{hare_chimpanzees_2004}.)</div>
        <div class="notes">
          \footnote{
          The contrast between the two conditions is not due merely to the fact that one involves a human and the other a chimpanzee. 
          Participants were also successful when the failed reach was executed by a human rather than another chimpanzee \citep[][experiment 1]{hare_chimpanzees_2004}.

        <div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">Why are these actions non-communicative?  Ayesha intends her fake yawn to have an effect on Ben, but the effect is a physiological one.  The response she wants from him is mechanical.</div>
        <div class="notes">But there are also non-communicative actions which require a rational response from the people they’re directed at.  For example:</div>
        <div data-what="li:eq(1)" data-class="blur-text" class="slide anim-continue anim-addclass"></div>
        <div data-what="li:eq(2)" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-continue anim-removeclass"></div>
        <div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">Note here that although Ayesha intends to provide Ben with misinformation, her action isn’t communicative.</div>
        <div class="notes">Intuitively, there’s a difference between deliberately providing information or misinformation to someone and communicating with her (Grice 1989: 218).  </div>
        <div class="notes">So what makes an action communicative?</div>
        <div class="notes">Paul Grice has a neat answer to this question.</div>
        <div class="notes">He notes that we sometimes achieve things merely by letting other people know that we intend to achieve them.</div>
        <div class="notes">Waving is one of the simplest examples:</div>
        <div data-what="li:eq(2)" data-class="blur-text" class="slide anim-continue anim-addclass"></div>
        <div data-what="li:eq(3)" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-continue anim-removeclass"></div>
        <div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">In this example, Ayesha’s goal is to get Ben to come over.  Her means of achieving this is to get Ben to recognise that this is what she intends.  So when she waves, her intention is that waving will let Ben know that she intends him to come over.</div>

          <div class="notes">The first suggestion concerns similarities:</div>
          <div class="notes">Tacit knowledge is analogous to belief at the level of input and output.</div>
          <p class="handout show">‘At the level of output, one who possesses the tacit knowledge that p is disposed to do and think some of the things which one who had the ordinary belief that p would be inclined to do an think (given the same desires).</p>

        <div class="step2 slide em-above">
          <div class="notes">Evans’ idea was ‘that while the applicability of the generality constraint is a necessary feature of propositional attitudes, states that are intuitively subdoxastic - particularly states of input systems - are not subject to that constraint.’  \citep[p.\ 146]{Davies:1986qv}</div>
          <p>The <span class="generality-constraint">generality constraint</span><span> applies to knowledge knowledge but not to tacit knowledge.</span></p>
          <div class="handout">‘(It is one of the fundamental differences between human thought and the information-processing that takes place in our brains that the Generality Constraint applies to the former but not to the latter.  When we attribute to the brain computations whereby it localizes the sounds we hear, we ipso facto ascribe it to representations of the speed of sound and of the distance between the ears, without any commitment to the idea that it should be able to represent the speed of light or the distance between anything else.)’</div>
