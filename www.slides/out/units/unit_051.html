    <title>Two Breakthroughs | Origins of Mind</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Two scientific breakthroughs that have recently furthered understanding of how knowledge might emerge in development. The first breakthrough is the discovery that preverbal infants enjoy surprisingly rich social abilities, abilities which may well be foundational for later linguistic abilities and enable the emergence of knowledge (e.g. Csibra &amp; Gergely 2009; Meltzoff 2007; Tomasello et al. 2005). A second breakthrough is the use of increasingly sensitive—-and sometimes controversial--methods to detect sophisticated expectations concerning causal interactions, numerosity, mental states and more besides in preverbal infants (e.g. Spelke 1990; Baillargeon et al. 2010)."/>

Preverbal infants manfiest a surprising range of social abilities.  
These include imitation, which can occur just days and even minutes after birth 
(Meltzoff & Moore 1977; Field et al. 1982; Meltzoff & Moore 1983), imitative learning 
(Carpenter et al. 1998), gaze following (Csibra & Volein 2008), goal ascription 
(Gergely et al. 1995; Woodward & Sommerville 2000), social referencing (Baldwin 2000) 
and pointing (Liszkowski et al. 2006).
Taken together, the evidence reveals that preverbal infants have surprisingly rich 
social abilities.

will require thinking about both core knowledge and social interaction.

          <p class="center">development as rediscovery</p>
          <div class="notes">To flesh this out, I want to introduce the idea that cognitive development is rediscovery.
(But not exactly as Plato's myth had it.)
          </div>
          <div class="notes">We can ask how humans get from one manifestation to the next.
I want to suggest that it involves a process of rediscovery.
I don't think it's a case of partial knowledge becoming gradually more complete.
Rather, I think the representations at earlier stages shape 
subject's body, behaviour and attention in ways that facilitate discovery at the next stage.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">And, most importantly, they enable increasingly right forms of social interaction.
It is these social interactions---together with the bodily, behavioural and mental changes---that 
enable subsequent re-discoveries. 
So, on this view, the role of some early-developing abilities in explaining the later acquisition 
of conceptual understanding does not involve direct representational connections; 
rather the early developing abilities facilitate or enable social interaction 
and influence attention and inform behaviour, 
and these influences facilitate development.

          <div class="notes">To make this vague idea slightly more concrete, let me zoom in. 
I think having verbal labels for things sometimes helps with acquiring concepts of them.
Now this sounds paradoxical. 
Doesn't having a label for something mean being able to label correctly? 
And how could you label correctly without the corresponding concept? 
My suggestion is that having core knowledge is not having a concept (many disagree); 
but core knowledge could underpin your correct use of a label. 
Now labels are acquired through social interaction, or so I suggested earlier. 
Hence the picture.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Now this picture needs two qualifications. 
First, it's missing some details, and these details will vary from case to case 
(what's true of knowledge of objects might not be true of knowledge of number). 
Second, the picture might be completely wrong. 
But even if the picture is wrong, I'll bet that social interaction and core knowledge are both 
essential for explaining how humans come to know things. 
So I don't claim to know how these two are necessary, only that they are. 
In fact my aim isn't primarily to explain to you how these two factors explain the origins of 
mind. 
Instead my hope is this. 
I'll give you the background on social interaction and core knowledge. 
And you'll tell me how these two (or perhaps other factors) are involved in explaining how 
humans come to know things about objects, colours, actions, numbers and the rest.
