  <div class="notes">Modules are widely held to play a central role in explaining mental development and in accounts of the mind generally.</div>
  <div class="notes">Jerry Fodor makes three claims about modules:</div><img src="/img/slide_emergence_warwick_027.jpg" class="bkg"/>

<section class="slide">
  <div class="notes">Not all researchers agree about the properties of modules.  That they are informationally encapsulated is denied by Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson (2002: 9), Simon Baron-Cohen (1995) and some evolutionary psychologists (Buller and Hardcastle 2000: 309), whereas Scholl and Leslie claim that information encapsulation is the essence of modularity and that any other properties modules have follow from this one (1999b: 133; this also seems to fit what David Marr had in mind, e.g. Marr 1982: 100-1).  According to Max Coltheart, the key to modularity is not information encapsulation but domain specificity; he suggests Fodor should have defined a module simply as 'a cognitive system whose application is domain specific' (1999: 118).  Peter Carruthers, on the other hand, denies that domain specificity is a feature of all modules (2006: 6).  Fodor stipulated that modules are 'innately specified' (1983: 37, 119), and some theorists assume that modules, if they exist, must be innate in the sense of being implemented by neural regions whose structures are genetically specified (e.g. de Haan, Humphreys and Johnson 2002: 207; Tanaka and Gauthier 1997: 85); others hold that innateness is 'orthogonal' to modularity (Karmiloff-Smith 2006: 568).  There is also debate over how to understand individual properties modules might have (e.g. Hirschfeld and Gelman 1994 on the meanings of domain specificity; Samuels 2004 on innateness).</div><img src="/img/slide_emergence_warwick_028.jpg" class="bkg"/>

<section class="slide">
  <div class="notes">In short, then, theorists invoke many different notions of modularity, each barely different from others.  You might think this is just a terminological issue.  I want to argue that there is a substantial problem: we currently lack any theoretically viable account of what modules are.  The problem is not that 'module' is used to mean different things-after all, there might be different kinds of module.  The problem is that none of its various meanings have been characterised rigorously enough.  All of the theorists mentioned above except Fodor characterise notions of modularity by stipulating one or more properties their kind of module is supposed to have.  This way of explicating notions of modularity fails to support principled ways of resolving controversy.</div>
  <div class="notes">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="notes">No key explanatory notion can be adequately characterised by listing properties because the explanatory power of any notion depends in part on there being something which unifies its properties and merely listing properties says nothing about why they cluster together.</div>
  <div class="notes">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="notes">Interestingly, Fodor doesn't define modules by specifying a cluster of properties (pace Sperber 2001: 51); he mentions the properties only as a way of gesturing towards the phenomenon (Fodor 1983: 37) and he also says that modules constitute a natural kind (see Fodor 1983: 101 quoted above). </div><img src="/img/slide_emergence_warwick_031.jpg" class="bkg"/>
</section>
<section class="slide">
  <div class="notes">It is tempting to appeal to spatial metaphors in thinking about modularity.  Just as academics tend to work at high-speed on domain-specific problems when they can cut themselves off from administrative centres, so we might attempt to explain the special properties of modules by saying that they are cut off from the central system.  But it isn't clear how to turn this metaphor into an explanation.  The spatial metaphor only gives us the illusion that we understand modularity.</div><img src="/img/slide_emergence_warwick_032.jpg" class="bkg"/>

<!-- *todo* mentioned modularity once already : return to that idea-->
<!-- structure: (1) modularity --- general solution to the problem-->
<!-- but modularity leaves open why the looking and not the searching (rather than conversely)?-->
<!-- because searching is purposive in a way that looking is not?  (searching depends on practical reasoning)-->
<!-- but why does the module affect looking, which seems purposive?-->
<!-- Scholl & Leslie --- it's implemented by the finst object indices-->
<!--    - use: (p. 12: 'These similarities have led to the view that adult attentional mechanisms may underlie infants’ performance on object individuation tasks (Carey & Xu, 2001; Chiang & Wynn, 2000; Leslie et al., 1998; Scholl, 2001; Scholl & Leslie, 1999; Simon, 1997; Wynn & Chiang, 1998).')-->
<!-- So (i) that's why it affects looking; (ii) the principles aren't represented in the simple sense --- they're how the system works-->
<!-- Further issue: developmental relation between core knowledge of the principles and the kind of knowledge that will inform acting-->
<!-- - (a) Spelke/Carey joining together with language-->
<!-- - (b) reflect on categorical perception: maybe it's development as rediscovery-->

        <div class="notes">There are perceptual expectations.</div>
        <div class="notes">Suppose you saw this image.</div>
        <div class="notes">The triangle behind the thumb is in some sense perceptually present, even though you can't see it.</div>
        <div data-what="img" data-attr="clip:auto" class="slide anim-continue anim-attribute"></div>
        <div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">But now the thumb comes away and what you see is not the triangle you were expecting.</div>
        <div class="notes">Could these perceptual expectations be just a matter of knowledge?</div>
        <div class="notes">No, because perceptual expectations are judgement-independent.</div>
        <div class="notes">As \citep{kellman:1983_perception} report, Michotte, Thines and Crabbe found that subjects report seeing a single large triangle behind the thumb even when they know that there isn't one there.</div>
        <div class="notes">You can cover and reveal the triangles repeatedly, but the expectation will hold firm.</div>
        <div class="notes">&nbsp;</div>
        <div class="notes">The experience you have when the thumb is removed is like that of infants' in violation-of-expectation tasks.</div>
        <div class="notes">This is what it is like to be an infant.</div>
