  <div class="notes">Limited accessbility is a familar feature of many cognitive systems.</div>
  <div class="notes">When you grasp an object with a precision grip, it turns out that there is a very reliable pattern.</div>
  <div class="notes">At a certain point in moving towards it your fingers will reach a maximum grip aperture which is normally a certain amount wider than the object to be grasped, and then start to close.</div>
  <div class="notes">Now there's no physiological reason why grasping should work like this, rather than grip hand closing only once you contact the object.</div>
  <div class="notes">Maximum grip aperture shows anticipation of the object: the mechanism responsible for guiding your action does so by representing various things including some features of the object.</div>
  <div class="notes">But we ordinarily have no idea about this.</div>

        <div class="notes">To sum up, there are two problems with the notion of core knowledge ...</div>
        <div class="notes show">
          <p>core systems -- questions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Is appealing to core systems (modules) explanatory?</li>
            <li>Can the Core Knowledge View explain the discrepancy?</li>
            <li>Is the view I've been developing consistent with the Core Knowledge View?</li>
            <li>Is core knowledge all one thing?</li>
            <li>How do you get from core knowledge to knowledge knowledge?</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="notes">The Core Knowledge View is the view that infants' competence with objects, causes, colours
and the rest depends not on knowledge (as the Simple View has it) but on core knowledge.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">On the first question, I could tell you a long story about computational processes and 
representational formats.  But I won't do that here.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">On the second question, I think the answer is probably yes because the difference in
representational formats between knowledge proper and core knowledge explains limited
accessibility, and this in turn partially explains the discrepancies.
(But note that it doesn't explain is why the discrepacies fall exactly where they do.)
        </div>
        <div class="notes">On the third question, I think that thinking about categorical perception, or the perceptual 
systems that underpin objects indexes is a way of getting at what core knowledge really 
involves.  Core systems are not always something over and above perceptual and motor systems
(although it seems probably that they sometimes are if our competence with syntax rests on 
core knowledge).
        </div>
        <div class="notes">On the fourth question,
Most people are committed to there being different stories for (a) colour (categorical 
perception); (b) syntax (tacit knowledge); and (c) physical objects.
I'm not sure. I'm tempted to think that perceptual and motor cognition are at the root of these 
in every case, but this is a radical idea for which there is currenly very little evidence.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">The fifth question is just a variant of what I called The Problem (see lecture 2; it arises 
from the failure of the Simple View).

  <div class="notes">Not all researchers agree about the properties of modules.  That they are informationally encapsulated is denied by Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson (2002: 9), Simon Baron-Cohen (1995) and some evolutionary psychologists (Buller and Hardcastle 2000: 309), whereas Scholl and Leslie claim that information encapsulation is the essence of modularity and that any other properties modules have follow from this one (1999b: 133; this also seems to fit what David Marr had in mind, e.g. Marr 1982: 100-1).  According to Max Coltheart, the key to modularity is not information encapsulation but domain specificity; he suggests Fodor should have defined a module simply as 'a cognitive system whose application is domain specific' (1999: 118).  Peter Carruthers, on the other hand, denies that domain specificity is a feature of all modules (2006: 6).  Fodor stipulated that modules are 'innately specified' (1983: 37, 119), and some theorists assume that modules, if they exist, must be innate in the sense of being implemented by neural regions whose structures are genetically specified (e.g. de Haan, Humphreys and Johnson 2002: 207; Tanaka and Gauthier 1997: 85); others hold that innateness is 'orthogonal' to modularity (Karmiloff-Smith 2006: 568).  There is also debate over how to understand individual properties modules might have (e.g. Hirschfeld and Gelman 1994 on the meanings of domain specificity; Samuels 2004 on innateness).</div><img src="/img/slide_emergence_warwick_028.jpg" class="bkg"/>

<section class="slide">
  <div class="notes">In short, then, theorists invoke many different notions of modularity, each barely different from others.  You might think this is just a terminological issue.  I want to argue that there is a substantial problem: we currently lack any theoretically viable account of what modules are.  The problem is not that 'module' is used to mean different things-after all, there might be different kinds of module.  The problem is that none of its various meanings have been characterised rigorously enough.  All of the theorists mentioned above except Fodor characterise notions of modularity by stipulating one or more properties their kind of module is supposed to have.  This way of explicating notions of modularity fails to support principled ways of resolving controversy.</div>
  <div class="notes">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="notes">No key explanatory notion can be adequately characterised by listing properties because the explanatory power of any notion depends in part on there being something which unifies its properties and merely listing properties says nothing about why they cluster together.</div>
  <div class="notes">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="notes">Interestingly, Fodor doesn't define modules by specifying a cluster of properties (pace Sperber 2001: 51); he mentions the properties only as a way of gesturing towards the phenomenon (Fodor 1983: 37) and he also says that modules constitute a natural kind (see Fodor 1983: 101 quoted above). </div><img src="/img/slide_emergence_warwick_031.jpg" class="bkg"/>
</section>
<section class="slide">
  <div class="notes">It is tempting to appeal to spatial metaphors in thinking about modularity.  Just as academics tend to work at high-speed on domain-specific problems when they can cut themselves off from administrative centres, so we might attempt to explain the special properties of modules by saying that they are cut off from the central system.  But it isn't clear how to turn this metaphor into an explanation.  The spatial metaphor only gives us the illusion that we understand modularity.</div><img src="/img/slide_emergence_warwick_032.jpg" class="bkg"/>
