        <div class="notes">For example, objects arranged as on your left were percevied by 3-month-olds as two objects, whereas infants treated the displays like that on your right as if they were one object.</div>
        <div class="notes">(This was measured using a habituation paradigm \citep{kestenbaum:1987_perception}.  Infants were habituated to the display.  Then either one object's position changed, or both objects' positions changed but in such a way as to preserve the overall configuration of the two objects.  Infants could show that they perceived the configuration as a single object by looking longer when just one object's position changed.)</div>

        <div class="notes">The smaller of the two objects was always closer to the infants.  Infants should reach more often for the smaller, nearer object when they represent the simuli as a single object than when they represent it as two objects.</div>
        <div class="notes">Exploiting this fact, \citet[Experiment 2]{spelke:1989_reaching} showed that infants perceive the stimlui on your left as two objects but the stimlui on your right as a single object.</div>

        <div class="handout ctd notes">
          <p>\begin{enumerate}</p>
          <p>\item We (as perceivers) start with a cross-modal representation of three-dimensional perceptual features which includes their locations and trajectories.</p>
          <p>\item Our task is to get from these representations of features to representations of objects.</p>
          <p>\item \emph{Descriptive component} We do this as if in accordance with certain principles (cohesion, boundedness, rigidity, and no action at a distance).</p>
          <p>\item \emph{Explanatory component}  We acquire representations of objects because we apply the principles to representations of features and draw appropriate inferences.</p>

        <div class="notes">The key point for our purposes is the explanatory component.</div>
        <div class="notes">The principles are not supposed to be merely heuristics for describing and predicting infants’ performance on preferential looking tasks.</div>
        <div class="notes">Rather, these principles are supposed to explain why infants look longer at some things than at others.</div>
        <div class="notes">This what motivates the hypothesis that infants know these principles and use them in reasoning about objects: unless this hypothesis is true, it’s hard to understand how the principles could have explanatory relevance.   </div>

          <div class="handout">‘Chomsky’s nativism is primarily a thesis about knowledge and belief; it aligns problems in the theory of language with those in the theory of knowledge.  Indeed, as often as not, the vocabulary in which Chomsky frames linguistic issues is explicitly epistemological.  Thus, the grammar of a language specifies what its speaker/hearers have to know qua speakers and hearers; and the goal of the child’s language acquisition process is to construct a theory of the language that correctly expresses this grammatical knowledge.’</div>

          <div class="handout">
            The principles of object perception are things that we know, 
            and we generate expectations from these principles by a process of inference.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">The simple view is that the Spelke principles are just known in whatever sense anything is known.</div>
          <div class="notes">The simple view isn’t exactly Spelke’s, but it’s a useful starting point for discussion.</div>
          <div class="notes">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="notes">Now you might think that the case for these principles is not yet very strong.</div>
          <div class="notes">In which case, asking hard questions about their status is not necessary.</div>
          <div class="notes">So let’s consider further evidence for these principles.</div>
          <div class="notes">We can do this by turning from segmentation (which was our first requirement on knowledge of objects) <span>to representing objects as permanent.</span></div>
