that four and five month old infants appear to be surprised when a solid object is placed behind a drawbridge 
and then the drawbridge rotates back 180 degrees as if the object wasn't there.  
But if you put a desirable object behind a screen, these infants won't ever search behind the screen for the object. 
So if we measure their looking behaviours, they seem to know that an object is behind the screen; 
but if we measure their searching behaviours they seem not to know this.</div><div class="brightness-150"><div style="position:relative;"><img src="/img/baillargeon_1987_fig1.png" style="clip: rect(237px,320px,550px,0px); position: absolute; max-width:720px; max-height:550px;"/></div></div><p class="source">Baillargeon et al (1987, figure 1)</p></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><div class="notes">The problem for the simple view is that it correctly predicts looking behaviours but not searching behaviours.</div><div class="notes">This problem arises a second time in the case of infants' abilities to track causal interactions.</div><div class="notes">Suppose you roll a ball down this ramp and remove it from behind one of the doors.</div><div class="notes">You can predict where the ball will stop because you can see this barrier sticking up here.</div><div class="notes">2 and 2.5 year olds will look longer if you remove it from any door other than the right one.</div><div class="notes">These children and infants can also predict the location of the object (not just identify a violation, but look forward to where the object is) \citep{mash:2006_what}.</div><div class="notes">But if you ask them to remove the ball (and offer them a reward for doing so),
