        <div class="notes">Could these perceptual expectations be just a matter of knowledge?</div>
        <div class="notes">No, because perceptual expectations are judgement-independent.</div>
        <div class="notes">As \citep{kellman:1983_perception} report, Michotte, Thines and Crabbe found that subjects report seeing a single large triangle behind the thumb even when they know that there isn't one there.</div>
        <div class="notes">You can cover and reveal the triangles repeatedly, but the expectation will hold firm.</div>

        <div class="notes">Important because it shows limits (people know better than their perceptual systems)</div>

        <div class="notes">adults, including trained physicists who make correct verbal predictions about the effects of mass on motion, show representational momentum (a perceptual effect) consistent with impetus and inconsistent with Newtonian mechanics.  So again we have (i) judgement-independence and (ii) adults.  ('both physics experts and novices possess the same set of implicit beliefs about motion.' \citep[p.\ 451]{kozhevnikov:2001_impetus})</div>
        <div class="notes">--- limits of infants' systems found in adults shows that we can identify the system as persisting </div>
        <div class="notes">--- note that other studies also show judgement-independence, but in the other way (implicit knowledge of physical interactions more accurate than judgement: 'a number of previous studies suggesting a dissociation between explicit and implicit knowledge of the principles of physics. For instance, Hubbard suggests that implicit knowledge reflects internalization of invariant physical principles, whereas explicit knowledge about motion may be less accurate. Similarly, Krist et al. (1993) suggested that perceptually based knowledge is more accurate than verbal concepts of motion.' \citep[p.\ 450]{kozhevnikov:2001_impetus}</div>
        <div class="notes">--- What questions does this bear on?  (1) perceptual & modular nature of infants' understanding of objects and their interactions; (2) relation between infant competence and adults' (do the thing about system being transformed or discarded versus two systems persisting through development : this is different from issues about innateness, which looks from infants' competence backwards --- here we go in the other direction, looking forwards); and (3) trade-offs between flexibility and efficiency (see below; worth talking about this in some detail here)</div>
        <div class="notes">--- on cognitive efficiency:  	'To extrapolate objectsâ€™ motion on the basis of physical principles, one should have assessed and evaluated the presence and magnitude of such imperceptible forces as friction and air resistance operating in the real world.  This would require a time-consuming analysis that is not always possible. In order to have a survival advantage, the process of extrapolation should be fast and effortless, without much conscious deliberation. Impetus theory allows us to extrapolate objectsâ€™ motion quickly and without large demands on attentional resources.' \citep[p.\ 450]{kozhevnikov:2001_impetus}</div>
        <div class="notes">**caution (basically fine, but need to be careful): 'The extent to which displacement reflects physical principles per se has been widely debated in the literature; theories of displacement suggest a variety of potential effects of physical principles ranging from an incorporation of the principle of momentum into mental representation (e.g., Finke et al., 1986) to a rejection of any internalization of physical principles (e.g., Kerzel, 2000, 2003a). The empirical evidence is clear that (1) displacement does not always correspond to predictions based on physical principles and (2) variables unrelated to physical principles (e.g., the presence of landmarks, target identity, or expectations regarding a change in target direction) can influence displacement. ... information based on a naive understanding of physical principles or on subjective consequences of physical principles appears to be just one of many types of information that could potentially contribute to the displacement of any given target' \citep[p.\ 842]{hubbard:2005_representational}</div>
