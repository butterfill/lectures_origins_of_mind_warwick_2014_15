    <meta name="description" content="An utterance is an action with a complex structure.  Recovering this structure requires several transitions: from continous sounds and bodily movements to phonetic gestures; from phonetic gestures to words; and from words to clauses and sentences.

        <div class="notes">Consider an utterance of sentence like 'Isabel slept and Lily cried'.</div>
        <div class="notes">What is the structure of this utterance?</div>
        <div class="notes">First we can break the sentence down into two sentences and a connective.</div>
        <div class="notes">Then we break these into words.</div>
        <div class="notes">And the words break down into phonemes.</div>
        <div class="notes">Which are eventually realised in continous bodily movements and the sounds these produce.</div>
        <div class="notes">This is a very simplified picture.</div>
        <div class="notes">But already we can see that comprehending an utterance will involve several steps.</div>
        <div class="notes">Consider someone experiencing linguistic communication for the first time.</div>
        <div class="notes">She is experiences continuous bodily movements and their acoustic consequences.</div>
        <div class="notes">From these she has somehow to extract the phonetic gestures.</div>
        <div class="notes">And then she has to group the phonetic gestures into words.</div>
        <div class="notes">And finally she has to work out the syntactic structure of the words.</div>
        <div class="notes">How does this help?</div>
        <div class="notes">It turns out that the abilitues to make these different steps involves largely different mechanisms, and that the steps can be made independently of each other (not that there aren't bottom-up and top-down effects, just that these appear to be inessential in some cases).</div>
        <div class="notes">Our question can be broken down accordingly.</div>
        <div class="notes">Our question How do humans come to have abilities to communicate by language?</div>
        <div class="notes">We can break the process of language comprehension into a series of transitions, from bodily movements and their acoustic effects to phonemes &c.</div>
        <div class="notes">And we can think of language production as involving the same transitions, but in reverse.</div>
        <div class="notes">And then our question can be broken down accordingly.</div>
        <div class="notes">We don't have to ask how humans come to have abilities to communicate by language all in one go.</div>
        <div class="notes">Instead we can ask how humans come to be able to identify phonemes in continous bodily movements and their acoustic effects, and how they come to identify words from uninterrupted sequences of phonemes, and so on.</div>
        <div class="notes">In this way, our question becomes tractable.</div>
