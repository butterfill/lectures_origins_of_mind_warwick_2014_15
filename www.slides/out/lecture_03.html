        <div class="notes">For example, objects arranged as on your left were percevied by 3-month-olds as two objects, whereas infants treated the displays like that on your right as if they were one object.</div>
        <div class="notes">(This was measured using a habituation paradigm \citep{kestenbaum:1987_perception}.  Infants were habituated to the display.  Then either one object's position changed, or both objects' positions changed but in such a way as to preserve the overall configuration of the two objects.  Infants could show that they perceived the configuration as a single object by looking longer when just one object's position changed.)</div>

        <div class="notes">Here's a second example.</div>
        <div class="notes">In this case \citep[Experiment 2]{spelke:1989_reaching}, the researchers tested 5-month-old infants using a reaching paradigm.</div>
        <div class="notes">The smaller of the two objects was always closer to the infants.  Infants should reach more often for the smaller, nearer object when they represent the simuli as a single object than when they represent it as two objects.</div>
        <div class="notes">Exploiting this fact, \citet[Experiment 2]{spelke:1989_reaching} showed that infants perceive the stimlui on your left as two objects but the stimlui on your right as a single object.</div>
        <div class="notes">&nbsp;</div>
        <div class="notes">But how does the principle of cohension apply to this moving display? <span>â€˜When two surfaces are separated by a spatial gap (as in Figure 4a) or undergo relative motions that alter the adjacency relations among points at their border (as in Figure 4i), the surfaces lie on distinct objects.â€™</span></div>

          <div class="handout">â€˜Chomskyâ€™s nativism is primarily a thesis about knowledge and belief; it aligns problems in the theory of language with those in the theory of knowledge.  Indeed, as often as not, the vocabulary in which Chomsky frames linguistic issues is explicitly epistemological.  Thus, the grammar of a language specifies what its speaker/hearers have to know qua speakers and hearers; and the goal of the childâ€™s language acquisition process is to construct a theory of the language that correctly expresses this grammatical knowledge.â€™</div>

  <div class="notes">Modules are widely held to play a central role in explaining mental development and in accounts of the mind generally.</div>

  <div class="notes">Not all researchers agree about the properties of modules.  That they are informationally encapsulated is denied by Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson (2002: 9), Simon Baron-Cohen (1995) and some evolutionary psychologists (Buller and Hardcastle 2000: 309), whereas Scholl and Leslie claim that information encapsulation is the essence of modularity and that any other properties modules have follow from this one (1999b: 133; this also seems to fit what David Marr had in mind, e.g. Marr 1982: 100-1).  According to Max Coltheart, the key to modularity is not information encapsulation but domain specificity; he suggests Fodor should have defined a module simply as 'a cognitive system whose application is domain specific' (1999: 118).  Peter Carruthers, on the other hand, denies that domain specificity is a feature of all modules (2006: 6).  Fodor stipulated that modules are 'innately specified' (1983: 37, 119), and some theorists assume that modules, if they exist, must be innate in the sense of being implemented by neural regions whose structures are genetically specified (e.g. de Haan, Humphreys and Johnson 2002: 207; Tanaka and Gauthier 1997: 85); others hold that innateness is 'orthogonal' to modularity (Karmiloff-Smith 2006: 568).  There is also debate over how to understand individual properties modules might have (e.g. Hirschfeld and Gelman 1994 on the meanings of domain specificity; Samuels 2004 on innateness).</div><img src="/img/slide_emergence_warwick_028.jpg" class="bkg"/>

  <div class="notes">In short, then, theorists invoke many different notions of modularity, each barely different from others.  You might think this is just a terminological issue.  I want to argue that there is a substantial problem: we currently lack any theoretically viable account of what modules are.  The problem is not that 'module' is used to mean different things-after all, there might be different kinds of module.  The problem is that none of its various meanings have been characterised rigorously enough.  All of the theorists mentioned above except Fodor characterise notions of modularity by stipulating one or more properties their kind of module is supposed to have.  This way of explicating notions of modularity fails to support principled ways of resolving controversy.</div>
  <div class="notes">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="notes">No key explanatory notion can be adequately characterised by listing properties because the explanatory power of any notion depends in part on there being something which unifies its properties and merely listing properties says nothing about why they cluster together.</div>
  <div class="notes">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="notes">Interestingly, Fodor doesn't define modules by specifying a cluster of properties (pace Sperber 2001: 51); he mentions the properties only as a way of gesturing towards the phenomenon (Fodor 1983: 37) and he also says that modules constitute a natural kind (see Fodor 1983: 101 quoted above). </div><img src="/img/slide_emergence_warwick_031.jpg" class="bkg"/>
</section>
<section class="slide">
  <div class="notes">It is tempting to appeal to spatial metaphors in thinking about modularity.  Just as academics tend to work at high-speed on domain-specific problems when they can cut themselves off from administrative centres, so we might attempt to explain the special properties of modules by saying that they are cut off from the central system.  But it isn't clear how to turn this metaphor into an explanation.  The spatial metaphor only gives us the illusion that we understand modularity.</div><img src="/img/slide_emergence_warwick_032.jpg" class="bkg"/>

<!-- *todo* mentioned modularity once already : return to that idea-->
<!-- structure: (1) modularity --- general solution to the problem-->
<!-- but modularity leaves open why the looking and not the searching (rather than conversely)?-->
<!-- because searching is purposive in a way that looking is not?  (searching depends on practical reasoning)-->
<!-- but why does the module affect looking, which seems purposive?-->
<!-- Scholl & Leslie --- it's implemented by the finst object indices-->
<!--    - use: (p. 12: 'These similarities have led to the view that adult attentional mechanisms may underlie infantsâ€™ performance on object individuation tasks (Carey & Xu, 2001; Chiang & Wynn, 2000; Leslie et al., 1998; Scholl, 2001; Scholl & Leslie, 1999; Simon, 1997; Wynn & Chiang, 1998).')-->
<!-- So (i) that's why it affects looking; (ii) the principles aren't represented in the simple sense --- they're how the system works-->
<!-- Further issue: developmental relation between core knowledge of the principles and the kind of knowledge that will inform acting-->
<!-- - (a) Spelke/Carey joining together with language-->
<!-- - (b) reflect on categorical perception: maybe it's development as rediscovery-->
