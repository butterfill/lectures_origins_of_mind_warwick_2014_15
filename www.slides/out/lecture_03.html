My question is: How do infants first acquire knowledge of particular causal 
interactions among objects.
I want to approach this question in an odd way, by thinking about the perception of causation
in adults.
But before I come to that, I also want to mention that there is a second theme for this lecture.</div><div data-what=".step2" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-continue anim-removeclass"></div><div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div><div class="notes">In this lecture I want to consider several interlocking themes simultaneously.
The second theme is the problem I introduced in the last lecture, which arises from
the failure of the Simple View.
The problem is to understand the relation between infants' abilities regarding physical objects
and the Spelke principles which describe these given that the principles and their deliverances
are not actually knowledge.
It turns out that thinking about the perception of causation will help us with this theme too.</div><div class="notes">Now since the last lecture was a week ago, 
let me start by giving you a very recap.

that four and five month old infants appear to be surprised when a solid object is placed behind a drawbridge

But if you put a desirable object behind a screen, these infants won't ever search behind the screen for the object.

That they are informationally encapsulated is denied by Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson (2002: 9), Simon Baron-Cohen (1995) and some evolutionary psychologists (Buller and Hardcastle 2000: 309), whereas Scholl and Leslie claim that information encapsulation is the essence of modularity and that any other properties modules have follow from this one (1999b: 133; this also seems to fit what David Marr had in mind, e.g. Marr 1982: 100-1).  According to Max Coltheart, the key to modularity is not information encapsulation but domain specificity; he suggests Fodor should have defined a module simply as 'a cognitive system whose application is domain specific' (1999: 118).  Peter Carruthers, on the other hand, denies that domain specificity is a feature of all modules (2006: 6).  Fodor stipulated that modules are 'innately specified' (1983: 37, 119), and some theorists assume that modules, if they exist, must be innate in the sense of being implemented by neural regions whose structures are genetically specified (e.g. de Haan, Humphreys and Johnson 2002: 207; Tanaka and Gauthier 1997: 85); others hold that innateness is 'orthogonal' to modularity (Karmiloff-Smith 2006: 568).  There is also debate over how to understand individual properties modules might have (e.g. Hirschfeld and Gelman 1994 on the meanings of domain specificity; Samuels 2004 on innateness).</div><img src="/img/slide_emergence_warwick_028.jpg" class="bkg"/></section><section class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_emergence_warwick_029.jpg" class="bkg"/></section><section class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_emergence_warwick_030.jpg" class="bkg"/></section><section class="slide"><div class="notes">In short, then, theorists invoke many different notions of modularity, each barely different from others.  You might think this is just a terminological issue.  I want to argue that there is a substantial problem: we currently lack any theoretically viable account of what modules are.  The problem is not that 'module' is used to mean different things-after all, there might be different kinds of module.  The problem is that none of its various meanings have been characterised rigorously enough.  All of the theorists mentioned above except Fodor characterise notions of modularity by stipulating one or more properties their kind of module is supposed to have.  This way of explicating notions of modularity fails to support principled ways of resolving controversy.</div><div class="notes">&nbsp;</div><div class="notes">No key explanatory notion can be adequately characterised by listing properties because the explanatory power of any notion depends in part on there being something which unifies its properties and merely listing properties says nothing about why they cluster together.</div><div class="notes">&nbsp;</div><div class="notes">Interestingly, Fodor doesn't define modules by specifying a cluster of properties (pace Sperber 2001: 51); he mentions the properties only as a way of gesturing towards the phenomenon (Fodor 1983: 37) and he also says that modules constitute a natural kind (see Fodor 1983: 101 quoted above). </div><img src="/img/slide_emergence_warwick_031.jpg" class="bkg"/></section><section class="slide"><div class="notes">It is tempting to appeal to spatial metaphors in thinking about modularity.

Knowing that Sarah missed the conference is (let's suppose) adequate evidence for you to conclude that she is ill … until you discover that she couldn't resist visiting a cheese factory, or that she urgently needs to finish writing a paper.  So the adequate evidence relation is context dependent.  But since thinking requires sensitivity to whether evidence is adequate, some of the processes involved in thinking must be sensitive to context dependent relations.

Fodor starts by asking what thinking is, and answers that it's a special kind of Computational process.

The answer I'm suggesting is that modular cognition is a Computational process.
