  p sentences:

    li Which proposition expresses depends in part on which sentence it is an utterance of.
    li Sentences have meanings; the meaning of the sentence plus the context of utterance determines which proposition the utterance expresses.
    li Users of a language know the meanings of sentences in that language.
    li Knowing the meaning of a sentence someone utters enables one to know which proposition her utterance expresses.

    li words have meanings
    li speakers know the meanings of words

  .notes We can deepen this criticism of the mapping idea with an exercursion into philosophy of language.
  .notes Recall this quesiton, which we asked earlier.
  p.notes.show What do I know or understand when I can communicate with language?
  .notes I take it that proponents of mapping think the answer is a word-concept mapping, where the concept is the meaning of the word.
  .notes But here we should step back and ask how this knowledge is supposed to explain
  .notes The key is to start with a mildly sceptical attitude towards notions like meaning and concept.
  .notes They should only be introduced if we can say clearly why they are necessary.
  .notes On one way of thinking about what word meanings are for, they are necessary only to explain systematicity and productivity.

  p.center objection
  .notes I've focussed on “puttaputta” because it illustrates how even children with normal experiences of language sometimes coin their own words as soon as they start using words.
  .notes You might object that “puttaputta” is a very primitive use of language, somewhere between a word and a sentence.
  .notes But children also coin proper words such as “fire-dog” for a stray dog found near a fire (Clark 1998: 14) and “darking” for the action of colouring.
  .notes Here's an example:

  .notes This exeample shows Shem inventing the word “smashit.”  This is a nice complex example involving a noun probably derived from a verb (to smash) where Shem simultaneously explains what the word means and refines its pronunciation:
